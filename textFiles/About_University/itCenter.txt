<h4>IT Center</h4>                   
	<p> IT Centre was established in the year 2000 to create a Campus Wide 
Network by interconnecting various campuses and departments. First phase which was 
completed in April 2001, networked 18 departments having 524 nodes. Second phase was
 completed in Oct 2002, which connected ten more departments and installed 331 additional
 nodes. During third phase we have connected IET and Nalanda Campus to our central 
server located at IT Centre, Khandwa Road Campus. IET has been connected by laying 2.1 
kilometer fibre optic cable where as Nalanda Campus which is six kilometer away from
 Khandwa Road Campus has been connected using 2 Mbps leased line. During third phase
 expansion additional 150 nodes have been added to Nalanda Campus, RNT Marg Network 
and 128 nodes to IET network. After completion of third phase i.e. from Feb, 2004 
all the departments of the University are now on Campus LAN having access to the 
Internet.
