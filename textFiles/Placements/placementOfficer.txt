I feel honoured to invite you to this world of professionalism and commitment.<br><br>

The world progresses ahead with new technologies mushrooming almost everyday. In such a 
scenario someone should take responsibility to train the young generation in the right 
direction, so that they are at par with the latest technologies. I take pride in 
announcing that IIPS is one such institution, which has not only taken the above 
responsibility but is also handling it proficiently. Our latest batch of young 
professionals is working hard to be an essential part of this dynamic software industry.
 The intensive training and the encouraging learning environment of our institute has 
grilled in them not only an extensive subject knowledge but also a sense of commitment, 
diligence and the value of hard work.<br><br>

I am confident that after having an inside glimpse of IIPS through this brochure you 
would definitely be interested in testing our students by coming for the On-Campus 
recruitment. Furthermore I would like to express my gratitude towards those companies 
which have shown confidence in our students and have come in the past years for the 
On-Campus placements. They have become an eternal part of the lIPS family and have 
always received much more than their expectations from us.<br><br>
