the students with a podium to showcase their team spirit hone their leadership qualities 
and inculcates sportsman spirit in them. It not only helps to crack the ice between the 
students of different courses but also helps the new students to overcome their 
inhibition and gel along with the rest of the college. 'Synergy' provides an opportunity
 to break the monotonous academic schedule and test other life skills.The three day event
 shall include cricket, football, badminton, volleyball, basketball, athletics, table 
tennis; at the end of which everyone emerges a winner, some with medals some without. 
As a tradition synergy is organized by the students of third year with the support from 
the rest of the college in event management which shall further come to their avail in
 organizing the other major events in IIPS, viz, 'X!pressions'(organized mainly by the 
students of fourth year) and 'Samvardhan'(organized by the students of fifth year).The 
tears shed, the sweat dropped,the giggles,the occasional frowns, all make the event 
memorable and instills in the participants a new zeal to excel and reach the zenith.
