# Problem
	Removing .php extensions from the url (www.example.com/index.php), in order to make the URLs more user 
	and search engine friendly.

# Solution
	This can be achieved by simply creating a file named .htaccess file in the website directory.
	
# What is an .htaccess file ?
	* An .htaccess file is a simple ASCII file that you create with a text editor like Notepad or TextMate.
      It provides a way to make configuration changes on a per-directory basis.
	* Please note that .htaccess is the file’s extension. It isn’t file.htaccess, it is simply .htaccess.
	* .htaccess files affect the directory in which they are placed and all sub-directories. For example 
	  if there is one .htaccess file located in your root directory of yoursite.com, it would affect 
	  yoursite.com/content/, yoursite.com/content/images/, etc.

# Features
	With an .htaccess file you can:
		•	Redirect the user to different page
		•	Password protect a specific directory
		•	Block users by IP
		•	Preventing hot linking of your images
		•	Rewrite URIs
		•	Specify your own Error Documents

	To see how you can remove the extension from url, read the steps_rewritingURL.md file.
